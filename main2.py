    1. Read the user's input carefully.

    3. Match these to the closest possible symptom from the provided Available Symptoms List.
    4. If a symptom is not a direct match but is a clear synonym or related concept, use the official symptom name. For example, "headache" matches "headache," and "sore tummy" matches "abdominal pain."
    5. Do not hallucinate or create new symptoms. Only use symptoms from the provided list.
    6. Return a comma-separated list of the standardized symptoms. Do not include any other text or explanation in the response. If no symptoms match, return an empty string.
